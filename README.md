# JDBCLab

This project is a simple Java application that connects to a SQLite database and retrieves information from a `Books` table. The primary goal is to demonstrate how to establish a JDBC connection, execute a `SELECT` query, and properly manage database resources in Java.

### Main Class

- The `Main` class serves as the entry point for the application, creating an instance of `DatabaseConnector` and calling `selectAllBooks()`.
